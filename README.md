**Files**:

* Blender Files has the design build using blender in form of .obj file along with texture files and a python script named **config.py** & **objloader.py**.
* Embedded code has the **main.c** file written in Atmel studio 7 for ATmega 2560 board along with ZigBee protocol for receiving data.
* Images and Docs has the images and all the pdf used.
* Python code has **Main.py** which combines the shortest path algo with AR part using the code **python_AR.py** & **Graph.py**.

**Abstract:**

In this competition every team is given a theme like ours is Thirsty Crow and there are **28000 participants** out of which only 150 are selected for national finals at IIT Bombay and my team were in the finalists Our projects include a bot called crow which uses atmega2560 with LFR sensors to follow black line using the commands received through ZigBee protocol. The commands were send through companion computer which run A* shortest path algorithm along with that it includes the use of **OpenCV ,OpenGL for AR** in the project.

**Time Period:** 6 month long competition.

**Technology Used:**

AR, python, Embedded C on At-mega 2560, Blender, Path planning algo A*
